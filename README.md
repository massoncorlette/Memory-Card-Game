# React + Vite

https://deckofcardsapi.com/

using partialDeck api call to get all card suits only (13 cards total)

fetch the data from cardApi
functions.
setState and store card deck

function to reshuffle cards of the same deck with deck_id
(another api call?)

for every user click on card, saveState for user clicked cards

if same card clicked twice, game resets (new api call)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
